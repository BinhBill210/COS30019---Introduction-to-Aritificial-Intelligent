# Graph Search Algorithms in Python
This project implements various graph search algorithms including:

* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

* **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**

* **A*Search (AS)**

* **Custom Uninformed Search (CUS1)**: Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)

It parses graphs from a structured text file and finds optimal or heuristic-based paths from a start node to one or more goal nodes.
# Features
* Flexible and extensible graph parsing from file

* Modular implementation of different search strategies

* Heuristic support using Euclidean distance for GBFS and A*

* Clear output of solution path, total cost, and nodes generated

* Easy to add more custom algorithms
